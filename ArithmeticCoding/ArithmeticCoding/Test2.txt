BOOK lY. 
1. And they came to Lacedoemon, lying in the vale with deep 
ravines, and then drove to the dwelling of renowned Menelaus. 
And him they found giving many kinsmen the marriage feast 
of his son and noble daughter in his house. Her on the one 
hand he was sending to the son of Achilles, cleaver of armed 
ranks : for in Troy he first had promised and covenanted that 
he would give her, and now the gods for them ?vere bringing 
to fulfilment their marriage. Her then just now he was send- 
ing with horses and chariot to go on her way to the far-famed 
city of the Myrmidons, among whom Achilles' son held rule. 
On the other hand he was bringing from Sparta the daughter 
of Alector, for his son, strong Megapenthes, now grown to 
years, who had been born to him by a slave ; but to Helen 
nevermore did the gods grant offspring ever since indeed she 
bare a lovely child, Hermione, who had the beauty of golden 
Aphrodite. 
15. So they were feasting throughout the great high-vaulted 
hall, the neighbours and kinsfolk of renowned Menelaus, making 
merry : and amongst them was singing a divine bard, touching 
the lyre, and two tumblers among them as he began his song 
were whirling in their midst. 
20. But these twain on the contrary stood at the entrance of 
the house, both these twain and their horses twain, the hero 
Telemachus and Nestor's splendid son. And the lord Eteoneus 
coming forth saw them, the ready squire of renowned Menelaus ; 
and he proceeded to go through the palace to tell the shepherd 
of the people, and standing near spake winged words : 
OD. IV. 1 
2 HOMER. 
2(). 'Here surely are two strangers of some sort, ? Mcnelaus, 
reared of Zeus, ???? men, and they are like unto the seed of great 
Zeus. Come, tell me, whether shall we loose for them their 
swift horses, or send them onward to visit some other who will 
receive them with kindness ?' 
30. And to him in great wrath answered fair-haired Mene- 
laus : ' A fool thou wert not indeed, Eteoneus son of Boethous, 
aforetime : but now at least like a child thou pratest folly. 
Surely indeed it was but after having eaten much hospitable 
cheer from other men that we twain arrived hither, if so be 
perchance Zeus for the time to come will ease us of our sorrow. 
Nay, loose the horses of the strangers, and bring the men 
themselves forward that they may feast.' 
37. So spake he, and Eteoneus sped through the hall, and 
summoned other ready squires to follow with himself. And 
they loosed the sweating horses from beneath the yoke, and 
fastened them at the stalls of the horses, and beside them 
threw spelt, and therewith mingled white barley, and the chariot 
they tilted up against the shining faces of the gateway, and the 
men themselves they led into the divine hall ; and they, behold- 
ing it, wondered throughout the palace of the king, reared of 
Zeus, for there was a radiance like the radiance of the sun or 
moon throughout the high-vaulted palace of renowned Mene- 
laus. But when they were sated of gazing with their eyes, 
going into the well-polished baths, they bathed them. Now, 
when the handmaidens had bathed them and anointed them 
with oil, and then had cast about them thick woollen cloaks and 
doublets, they sat down on chairs by the side of Menelaus, son 
of Atreus. And an attendant bearing water for the hands in 
an ewer fair and golden, poured it forth over their hands above 
a silver basin, to wash withal ; and to their side she drew a 
polished table. And a grave dame bringing food set it by 
their side, laying upon the board many cates, lavishing of what 
was by her. And the carver raised on high and set before 
them dishes of divers meats, and placed by them golden cups. 
These twain accordingly fair-haired Menelaus greeted and 
spake : 
60. ' Both take ye of the food and be glad, and thereafter 
when ye have partaken of supper we shall ask you who of men 
ODYSSEY, BOOK IV. 3 
ye are ; for in you at least the blood of your parents is not 
lost, but ye are the seed of royal men, reared of Zeus, since 
base-born men could not beget sons like you.' 
65. So spake he and set before them the fat chine of an ox 
roasted, taking it in his hands, which they had placed as a 
token of honour before himself. And they plied their hands 
to the good cheer ready set before them. But when they had 
put from them the desire of meat and drink, then at length 
Telemachus addressed the son of Nestor, holding his head close 
to him, that the others might not hear : 
71. ' Mark thou, son of Nestor, dear to my heart, the gleam 
of bronze throughout the echoing halls, and the gleam of gold, 
and of amber, and of silver, and of ivory. Even such, I ween, 
is the court of Olympian Zeus within, for all the untold multi- 
tude of things that are here ; awe possesses me as I look upon 
them.' 
76. And as he spake fair-haired Menelaus perceived him and 
opening his mouth spake unto them winged words : 
78. ' Children dear, of a truth no mortal could vie with Zeus, 
for everlasting are his mansions and his treasures. But of men 
some one is sure to vie with me in treasures, or may be none 
will. Yea, for after much suffering and much wandering have 
I brought them in ships and come hither in the eighth year ; 
yea, having wandered o'er Cyprus, and Phoenicia, and Egypt, 
I came both to the Ethiopians, and to the Sidonians, and the 
Ererabi, and Libya, where e'en from their birth lambs are 
horned. For thrice the ewes yean within the maturing year. 
There neither master nor shepherd lacketh aught of cheese or 
meat or sweet milk, but ever do the ewes yield a continual store 
of milk to draw. While round those regions yet I was wander- 
ing, gathering together much store of livelihood, meanwhile 
another slew my brother by stealth, all unawares, by the guile 
of his accursed wife. So it is not of a truth with rejoicing that 
I rule over these riches. And this ye are sure to have heard 
from your fathers, whosoever they may be, since full much I 
have suffered, and let my house go to ruin, very fair though it 
was to dwell in and holding many treasures and goodly. Would 
that I lived in these halls though with but a third part of these 
treasures, and that those men were safe who perished of old in 
1—2 
4 HOMER. 
broad Troy, far from Argos, the land that breedeth horses. Yet, 
nevertheless, though I lament them all, and sob of ttimes as I 
sit in our halls — for a while I satisfy my heart with weeping, 
and again for a while I cease ; aye, soon comes a surfeit of chill 
weeping ; for these men, all of them, I lament not so much, 
though grieved, as for one only who makes me loathe food and 
sleep, when I think upon him, for no one of the Achaeans toiled 
po much as Odysseus toiled and ventured. But for him troubles 
were doomed to come, and to me sorrow for him never to be 
forgotten, to think how he is so long away, nor know we at all 
whether he indeed be alive or hath died. Yea, I ween there 
weep for him both the aged Laertes and wise Penelope, and 
Telemachus whom he left a child new-born in his house.' 
113. So he spake, and in the heart of Telemachus of a truth 
lie stirred a desire of tears for his sire ; and from his eyelids 
he let fall a tear unto the ground as he heard of his sire, 
holding up his purple cloak against his eyes with both hands. 
And Menelaus marked him and pondered thereat in his mind 
and in his heart whether he should allow him to make mention 
of his sire, or whether he should first question him and try him 
in every word. 
120. While yet he was pondering these things in his mind 
and in his heart, forth came Helen from her sweet-scented high- 
vaulted chamber, like unto Artemis of the golden spindle. And 
for her then at once Adreste set a well-wrought couch, and 
Alcippe bare a rug of soft wool, and Phylo bare a silver basket 
which Alcandre gave to her, the wife of Polybus, who dwelt in 
Egyptian Thebes, where are stored up very many treasures in 
the halls ; he gave unto Menelaus two silver baths, and two 
tripods and ten talents of gold. And besides that again his 
wife bestowed on Helen beauteous gifts ; both a golden spindle 
and a basket on wheels all of silver she added unto her, and the 
rims thereotti had been finished off with gold. This, then, her 
handmaiden Phylo bringing set beside her, stuffed full with 
dressed yarn ; but upon it lay stretched a spindle with wool of 
violet blue. And Helen sat her on the couch and beneath was 
a stool for her feet. And forthwith in uttered words she 
questioned her lord of each thing : 
138. ' Know we now, Menelaus, reared of Zeus, who of men 
ODYSSEY, BOOK IV. 5 
these be that claim to come to our house ? Shall I dissemble, or 
shall I speak out the truth ? Nay, my heart bids me speak, for 
I avow that never yet have I seeu anyone so like another, nor 
man nor woman — awe possesses me as I look upon him — as 
this man is like unto the son of great-hearted Odysseus, unto 
Telemachus, whom that hero left a child new-born in his house, 
when for the sake of shameless me ye Achaeans came up under 
Troy, planning bold war.' 
147. And unto her replying spake fair-haired Menelaus : ' So 
do I, too, lady, now mark the likeness as thou tracest it ; for 
such were the feet of that hero and such his hands, and the 
glances of his eyes and the head and the hair thereon. And 
lo ! of a truth even now I was telling of Odysseus, recalling 
him to mind, how many toils he went through, enduring hard- 
ships for my sake, and he let fall a bitter tear from beneath his 
brows, holding his purple cloak against his eyes.' 
155. And to him in turn Peisistratus, son of Nestor, answer- 
ing spake : 'Son of Atreus, Menelaus, reared of Zeus, leader of 
hosts, surely of a truth this is the son of that hero, even as thou 
sayest ; but he is discreet, and thinketh it shame in his heart 
coming here in this wise for the first time to make show of 
much talking in the presence of thee, in whose voice we two 
take pleasure as in the voice of a god. Now the knight Nestor 
of Gerenia sent me forth to go together with him as his guide ; 
for he longed to see thee that thou mightest suggest unto him 
some word or some work. For many sorrows hath a son in his 
halls when his father is gone thence, if he hath no others by 
him as his helpers ; and even so now Telemachus's father is 
gone thence nor hath he any others who in his township will 
keep off from him distress.' 
165. And to him answering spake fair-haired Menelaus : 
' Lo now, indeed, in very truth 'tis the son of a right dear friend 
that has come unto my house who for my sake toiled through 
many hardships ; and I thought to welcome him when he came 
before all other Argives,if far-seeing Olympian Zeus had granted 
us twain a return over the sea in our swift ships. And in 
Argos I would have given him a city to dwell in, and would 
have made him a house, having brought him from Ithaca with 
his goods and his son and all his folk, making one city desolate 
6 HOMER. 
of those that lie around us and are ruled o'er by myself. Then 
often being here would we have held converse together : nor 
would aught else have separated us twain, the welcoming and 
the welcomed, ere that indeed death's dark cloud wrapped us 
round. But of this, I ween, the god must himself have been 
jealous, who made him hapless with no home-coming.' 
183. So spake he and in them all stirred a desire of tears. 
She wept, even Argive Helen, the daughter of Zeus, and Tele- 
machus too wept, and Menelaus, son of Atreus, nor even did 
the son of Nestor keep tearless eyes, for he remembered in his 
heart the noble Antilochus whom the radiant son of the bright 
Dawn had slnin. He, thinking on him, spake winged words : 
190. ' Son of Atreus, Nestor the old man used to avow that 
thou wert wise beyond mortals, whenever we made mention of 
thee in his halls and questioned one another ; and now, if at all 
it may be, be persuaded by me : for I on my part find no 
pleasure in lamenting at supper-time : nay, but morning early- 
born shall serve for that ; and yet I deem it in no wise a shame 
to weep for whomsoever of mortals dieth and meeteth his fate. 
This, of a truth, is indeed the only honour we pay to miserable 
mortals, both to cut our hair and let fall a tear from our cheeks. 
For my brother too is dead, in nowise the meanest of the 
Argives ; and thou art sure to have known him ; for I on my 
part never met nor saw him ; but they say beyond all others 
was Antilochus exceeding swift to run and a stout warrior.' 
203. And to him answering, spake fair-haired Menelaus : 
' My friend, since thou hast said such things as a wise man 
might say and do — yea, even one who was older than thou — for 
of such a father too art thou born, wherefore also thou utterest 
wise things. And easily distinguished is the son of the man for 
whom Cronion weaveth prosperity both at bridal and at birth, 
even as now he granted to Nestor for ever all his days that he 
himself should grow old in comfort in his halls, and his sons 
moreover be wise and most valiant with the spear. Nay, we 
will let go by the grief which was erstwhile made, and let us 
once more bethink ourselves of supper, and let them pour water 
upon our hands ; and again at dawn shall there be stories for 
Telemachus and for me to tell one to the other even to the 
end.' 
ODYSSEY, BOOK ??^ 7 
216. So spake he, and Asphalion then poured water on their 
hands, the ready squire of renowned Menelaus, and they plied 
their hands to the good cheer ready spread before them. 
219. Then again did Helen, daughter of Zeus, turn to other 
thoughts. Forthwith she cast into the wine a drug whereof 
they drank, a drug both allaying sorrow and soothing wrath, 
bringing forgetfulness of all ills. Whosoever should drink 
thereof, when it was mixed in the cup, not for that day would 
he let fall a tear from his cheeks, not though both his mother 
and his father were dead, nor though before his face men slew 
his brother with the sword, or his dear son, and he saw it with 
his eyes. Such helpful drugs and so good had the daughter of 
Zeus, which Polydamna, the wife of Thon, bestowed on her, aii 
Egyptian woman where the grain-giving land yields herbs in 
greatest plenty, many helpful and many baleful mingled to- 
gether. And there every man is a leech skilled beyond all men ; 
yea, for they are of Paeeon's race. Now when she had cast in 
the drug, and had bidden them pour out the wine, once again 
making answer in words she addressed her lord,: 
235. ' Menelaus, son of Atreus, reared of Zeus, and lo ! ye 
too, sons of noble men : yet spite of all now to one and now to 
another Zeus giveth both good and evil, for he can do all things 
— now verily feast ye seated in our halls and delight you with 
tales, for I will tell ye one suited thereto. 
240. 'Now everyone of them all I cannot tell nor number, so 
many were the toils of stout-hearted Odysseus ; but what a 
deed was that which he, brave man, did and dared in the land of 
the Trojans, where ye Achseans suffered woes ! For having 
subdued himself with unseemly stripes and having thrown about 
his shoulders a sorry wrap, like unto a menial, he went down 
into the broad-streeted city of the foemen, and disguising him- 
self he made him like unto another man, a beggar, he who was 
nowise such an one at the ships of the Achaeans. Like unto 
him he entered the city of the Trojans, and they were heedless 
thereof all of them ; and I alone knew him, though in such 
guise, and kept questioning him ; but by his craft he avoided 
me. But when at last I was washing him and anointing him 
Avith oil, and had cast about him garments and sworn a mighty 
oath not to reveal Odysseus among the Trojans before at least 
? HOMER. 
he arrived uuto the swift ships and the huts, then indeed at last 
he revealed to me all the purpose of the Ach?eans. And having 
slain many of the Trojans with his long spear, he returned to 
the Argives and brought back to them much knowledge. Then 
the other Trojan women wept aloud, but my heart rejoiced, 
since already then my heart was turned to go back again to my 
home, and I groaned in repentance of the blindness that Aphrodite 
gave me when she led me away thither far from my own dear 
native land, quitting both my child and my bridal chamber and 
my lord, w^ho lacked not aught either in wisdom or beauty.' 
265. Then to her answering, spake fair-haired Menelaus : 
' Yerily of a truth, lady, all this tale hast thou told in due order.- 
Ere now have I heard both the counsel and the wisdom of 
many heroes, and have traversed much land, but never yet have 
I beheld such an one with mine eyes as was the dear mind of 
stout-hearted Odysseus. What a deed was that which he, brave 
man, did and dared in the well- wrought horse, wherein sat all we 
chieftains of the Argives bearing death and destruction to the 
Trojans ! Afterwards thou camest thither, and some god must 
have bidden thee, who wished to bring glory on the Trojans. 
And of a truth the god-like Deiphobus accompanied thee on thy 
way. Thrice didst thou go round the hollow snare, handling it 
all about, and didst call by name all the chieftains of the Danai, 
making thy voice like unto the voice of the wives of all the 
Argives. But T, and the son of Tydeus, and godlike Odysseus, 
sitting in their midst, heard thee as thou didst call ; and we 
two both were fain starting up, either to go out, or to answer 
thee at once from within. But Odysseus kept us back and held 
us, for all our longing. Then the other sons of the Achseans 
were all of them silent, but Anticlus alone desired still to 
answer thes with words : but Odysseus closed his mouth firmly 
with his strong hands, and saved all the Achaeans, and held him 
for so long until Pallas Athene led thee back again.' 
290. Then to him the wise Telemachus spake in reply : 
'Menelaus, son of Atreus, reared of Zeus, leader of hosts, all the 
harder is it ! for not a whit did this courage keep from him 
grievous death, not though his heart within him had been iron. 
But come, convey us to rest, that forthwith in sweet sleep we 
may take our joy of rest.' 
ODYSSEY, BOOK IV. 9 
296. So spake he, and Argive Helen bade the slaves set out 
bedsteads beneath the corridor, and cast thereon fair blankets of 
purple and spread above them coverlets, and lay thick mantles 
above all to wrap them therewith. So the maidens went forth 
from the hall, bearing torches in their hands, and spread the 
beds, and an attendant led forth the guests. They then slept 
there in the corridor of the house, the hero Telemachus and 
Nestor's radiant son, but the son of Atreus slept in the inmost 
chamber of the lofty house, and by him lay long-robed Helen, 
fairest of women. 
306. But so soon as the early-born dawn shone forth, rosy- 
fingered, then Menelaus of the loud war-cry roused him from 
his couch, and he put on his garments and about his shoulders 
set his sharp sword, and beneath his smooth feet bound his 
goodly sandals, and proceeded to go forth from his chamber, 
like unto a god in presence, and sat by Telemachus and spake 
to him and called him by his name : 
312. 'AVherefore hath thy need brought thee hither, hero 
Telemachus, unto goodly Lacedsemon, over the broad back of 
the sea ? Is it a public matter, or a private quest ? Herein 
tell me true.' 
315. And to him in turn wise Telemachus made reply : 
'Menelaus, son of Atreus, reared of Zeus, leader of hosts, I have 
come if so be thou mightest tell me some tidings of my father. 
My dwelling is being devoured, and my fat lands have gone to 
ruin, and of unfriendly men is my house full who ever slaughter 
my close-thronging flocks and my kine with trailing feet and 
crumpled horns — even the wooers of my mother, with arrogance 
beyond measure. Wherefore now am I come hither to thy 
knees, if so be thou art willing to tell me of his grievous death, 
if perchance thou didst see it with thine own eyes, or hast heard 
the tale from another wanderer ; for to be wretched exceedingly 
did his mother bear him. And speak me not honeyed words, in 
ruth or pity, nay but tell me frankly how thou didst get sight 
of him. I beseech thee, if ever my father the goodly Odysseus 
having made promise of any word or work did bring it to pass 
for thee in the land of the Trojans, where ye Achaeans suffered 
woes, remember these things now, I pray, and speak me 
true.' 
10 HOMER. 
332. And to him fair-haired Menelaus, sore vexed, made 
reply : ' Fie ! fie ! for shame ! truly in the bed of a strong- 
hearted man were they fain to lie, being themselves but 
cowards ! Even as when a hind, having laid to rest her new- 
born faAvns unweaned in the lair of a mighty lion, searcheth out 
then the mountain-shoulders and grassy dells seeking pasture, 
and afterward the lion cometh back to his bed, and lettefch loose 
unsightly doom upon both dam and fawns, even so upon these 
men shall Odysseus let loose unsightly doom. Ah, would that, 
? father Zeus, and Athene, and Apollo, being even such as 
once he was in well-stablished Lesbos, when in a match he 
wrestled with Philomeleides standing up to him and threw him 
mightily, and all the Achaeans rejoiced, ay, being even such, 
Odysseus might encounter the wooers ; all of them then would 
find a swift fate and a bitter wedlock ! But as for that of 
which thou askest and entreatest me, I indeed would not tell 
thee aught swerving from the truth, nor will I deceive thee, but 
what the old man of the sea told me, who speaketh true, of this 
not a word, mark me, will I conceal nor hide from thee. 
351. 'In the river ^gyptus the gods still held me back (though 
fain was I to come on hither), for that I had not offered unto 
them acceptable hecatombs ; and the gods ever wished that men 
should remember their commandments. Now there is an 
island in the midst of the loud-surging waves right against 
^gyptus, and men call it Pharos, as far off as a hollow ship 
makes in one day when the shrill blast bloweth behind her. 
And therein is a harbour with goodly anchorage whence they 
launch the well-rounded ships into the sea, when they have 
drawn the deep dark water. There the gods held me back 
twenty days, nor ever did the salt sea-breezes come with their 
breath, they that are the escorters of ships over the broad back 
of the sea. And now all our food would have been spent and 
the strength of our men, if one of the gods had not taken pity 
on me and saved me, the daughter of mighty Proteus, the old 
man of the sea, Eidothee ; for her heart most of all indeed did 
I move, who met me wandering alone apart from my comrades ; 
for ever did they roaming round the island, fish with bent 
hooks, and hunger gnawed their belly. And she, standing near 
me, uttered her voice and spake : " Art thou so utterly a fool, 
ODYSSEY, BOOK 1?'. 11 
stranger, and spiritless, or art thou ???1??1?7 reckless and hast 
pleasure in suffering sorrow ? So long time indeed art thou 
kept back in the island, nor even canst find any escape, and the 
heart of thy comrades is fainting." So she spake, but I answer- 
ing addressed her : "I will of a truth tell thee, whosoever of the 
goddesses thou art, how that in no wise ?villingly am I kept 
back here, but surely I must have sinned against the deathless 
gods, who hold the Avide heaven. But do thou now tell me — 
and the gods know all things — who of the deathless gods chains 
me here and hath hindered me from my way ; and tell me of 
my returning, how I may go over the fish-teeming deep." So I 
spake and straightway she replied, fairest of goddesses : " Yea, 
in very truth, stranger, I will tell thee full plainly. Hither 
resorteth that old man of the sea, who speaketh true, the death- 
less Egyptian Proteus, who knoweth the depths of every sea, 
Poseidon's underling, and they say that he is both my father 
and begat me. He, if perchance thou canst catch him, laying a 
snare for him, will surely tell thee of thy way, and of the 
measure of thy path, and of thy return, how thou may'st go 
over the fish-teeming deep. And he will tell thee, ? thou 
reared of Zeus, if thou art fain, what both good and evil hath 
been wrought in thy halls, while thou wert away on thy long 
and grievous journey." So she spake, and I answering addressed 
her : '' Do thou thyself devise now the snare for that old man 
divine, lest by chance catching sight of me first, or knowing of 
my coming, he escape me ; for a god is hard indeed for mortal 
man to subdue." So I spake, and straightway she answered, 
fairest of goddesses : " Yea, in very truth, stranger, I will tell 
full plainly. Whensoever the sun reacheth mid-heaven, then 
indeed will the old man of the sea, who speaketh true, come 
forth from the sea, before the breath of Zephyrns, hidden by 
the dark ripple of the sea ; and coming forth he lies down to 
sleep in the hollow caves. And around him the seals, the brood 
of the fair daughter of the brine, sleep all together, coming up 
from the hoary brine, breathing forth a bitter scent of the sea 
with its many depths. There will I, leading thee with the 
dawning of the day, lay you all to rest in order ; so do thou 
choose out three comrades who are the best in thy well-benched 
ships. And I will tell thee all the magic arts of that old man. 
1 2 HOMER. 
The seals first of all he will count over and go his round ; but 
when he has numbered and seen them all, then will he lie down 
in their midst, like a shepherd amidst his flock of sheep. Now 
as soon as ever ye see him couched, then indeed mind ye of both 
your might and your valour, and hold him there, though he be 
fain and eager to escape. And he will do his endeavour by 
changing into all living creatures that are made to creep upon 
the earth, and into water and fierce fire. But do ye hold him 
strongly and press him still the more. And when at length he 
questions thee in words in his own shape, even as he was when 
ye saw him couched, then indeed, hero, cease from thy violence, 
and let the old man go free, and ask him who of the gods 
causeth thee hardship, and ask of thy returning, how thou shalt 
go over the fish-teeming deep." So having spoken she dived 
beneath the seething main. But I went to the ships where they 
stood in the sand, and o'er many things my heart brooded darkly 
within me as I went. But when I had come to the ship and to 
the sea, and we made ready our supper and immortal night had 
come on, then indeed did we lay us down to sleep by the 
breakers of the sea. But soon as early-born Dawn appeared, 
rosy-fingered, then verily did I walk by the shore of the wide- 
wayed sea, praying much to the gods : and I took with me three 
of my comrades, in whom I had most confidence for every 
enterprise. 
435. ' But meanwhile she having dived beneath the broad 
bosom of the sea, brought up from out the deep the skins of 
four seals, and they were all newly-flayed ; she was planning a 
snare for her father. And having scooped out lairs in the sea 
sand she sat awaiting us : and we came very near her, and she 
laid us all down in order and threw a skin over each. Then 
would our ambush have been very grievous ; for the very 
deadly stench from the sea-bred seals distressed us sorely. 
Who would lay him down by a monster of the sea ? But 
herself she saved us, and devised a great boon ; for bringing 
ambrosia of a very sweet savour, she set it underneath the 
nostrils of each man, and did away with the stench of the 
monsters. And all the morning we waited with enduring 
heart ; and the seals came out of the sea all together, and then 
they laid them to rest in order by the edge of the breakers of 
ODYSSEY, BOOK IV. 13 
the sea ; and at noon the old man came forth from the sea and 
found the seals all plump, and then went o'er them all and 
counted their number, and first among the monsters he 
reckoned us, and nowise deemed in his heart that there was a 
snare ; and afterwards he too himself laid him down. 
454. ' Then we shouting rushed upon him and cast our hands 
about him ; nor did the old man forget his guileful skill. But 
lo ! first of all he became a lion of goodly beard, then after- 
wards a snake, and a leopard, and a mighty boar ; and he 
changed him to running water and a tall flowering tree. But 
we held him firmly with enduring heart. And when at last 
the old man, who knew magic arts, grew weary, then indeed 
questioning me in words he spake : " Who of the gods, prithee, 
was it, son of Atreus, that gave thee counsel, so that thou 
mightest take me against my will, laying for me a snare ? 
"What needest thou ?" So spake he, and I answering him said : 
" Thou knowest, old man ; why dost thou speak thus, seeking to 
lead me astray ? For truly I am ke})t back long time in this 
isle, nor can I find any remedy, and my heart faileth within me. 
But do thou tell me — and the gods know all things — Avhich of 
the deathless gods chains me here and hath hindered me from 
my way, and tell me of my returning, how I may go over the 
fish-teeming deep." So spake I, and straightway replying he 
addressed me : " Nay surely thou should'st have offered goodly 
sacrifices both to Zeus and to the other gods, and then embarked 
so that most speedily thou mightest have come to thine ???? 
country over the wine-dark deep. For it is not thy fate erst 
both to see thy friends and come to thy well-stablished house, 
and to thy fatherland, ere at least that thou come yet again to 
the water of the iEgyptus, the heaven-fed stream, and do 
sacrifice of holy hecatombs to the deathless gods Avho hold the 
wide heaven ; then also will the gods grant thee the path for 
which thou yearnest." So spake he, but my dear heart within 
me was broken, for that he bade me once again to go unto 
^gyptus over the murky deep, a long journey and grievous. 
But even so answering him in Avords I spake : " These things 
even thus, old man, will I perform, as thou commandest. But 
come, tell me this and speak it out downright : Have all the 
Achieans returned unscathed with their ships, whom Nestor and 
14 HOMER. 
I left when we went from Troy, or has any one of them 
perished by a bitter doom on board his own ship or in the arms 
of his friends when he had wound up the clew of war ?" So 
spake I, and straightway answering me he said : 
492. ' " Son of Atreus, why questionest thou me of this ? 
Nay, it behoveth thee not to know or to learn all my mind : 
and I avow that thou shalt not long be tearless when thou dost 
hear it all aright. For many of these men were slain, and 
many left ; but two only of the leaders of the mail-coated 
Achteans perished in their return — and at the battle thou thy- 
self wast present — and one, I ween, still alive is kept far from 
home on the broad sea. Ajax in truth was slain amidst his 
long-oared ships. At first Poseidon brought him nigh to Gyrse, 
to the mighty rocks, and saved him from the sea ; and so would 
he have escaped his fate, even though hated by Athene, if he 
had not let fall an overweening word, and been sorely blinded 
with presumption. He said that in the gods' despite he had 
escaped the mighty depths of the sea. And Poseidon heard 
him loudly boasting ; then straightway taking his trident in 
his mighty hands, he smote the Gyraean rock and clave it 
asunder. And one part there remained in its place, but the 
other fell into the sea, the broken mass whereon Ajax, seated at 
the first, had been blinded with presumption. And him it 
carried down through the vast seething main. So there he then 
died when he had drunk the briny water. But thy brother 
verily escaped the fates and avoided them in his hollow ships : 
and lady Here saved him. But when at length he was speedily 
about to come to the steep mount of Malea, then did the storm- 
wind snatching him up bear him loudly moaning over the fish- 
teeming deep to the borders of the country where of yore 
Thyestes dwelt, but at that time ^Egisthus, son of Thyestes, 
dwelt there. But when at length thence too there gleamed 
forth a vision of a safe return, and the gods changed back the 
breeze to fair, and they had reached home, verily of a truth 
Avith joy set he foot upon his own native-land and kissed his 
native-land, as he touched it ; and many hot tears fell from his 
eyes, for with gladness did he look upon his country. But from 
his watch-tower there saw him the spy whom crafty ^gisthus 
bringing had set there, and promised him a reward, two talents 
ODYSSEY, BOOK IV. 15 
of gold ; and he kept watch for a year lest Acraraemnon should 
escape unnoticed as he passed him, and should remember his 
impetuous valour. So he proceeded to go to the palace to tell 
the tidings to the shepherd of the people. And forthwith 
jfEgisthus devised a crafty snare. Choosing twenty of the best 
men in the township, he placed an ambush, and at the other side 
of the hall bade them prepare a feast. Meantime he went with 
chariots and horses to bid to the feast Agamemnon, shepherd 
of the people, pondering cruel thoughts. And he brought him 
up, all ignorant of his doom, and having feasted him, slew him, 
as one slayeth an ox at the stall. Nor was there one left of the 
comrades of Atrides who followed with him, nor e'en one of 
the comrades of ^gisthus, but they ?vere slain in the halls." 
So spake he, but my heart ?vithin me was broken, and I wept 
seated on the sand, nor truly was my heart fain to live any 
longer and to behold the light of the sun. But when I was 
sated both of weeping and of grovelling in the sand, then 
indeed the old man of the sea, who speaketh true, addressed me : 
"No longer, son of Atreus, mourn so long time unceasingly, 
since thereby we find no end ; but with all speed make trial, 
that so thou mayest come to thine own father-land. For either 
thou Avilt find the murderer still alive, or else Orestes will have 
slain him coming before thee : and thou wilt chance upon his 
funeral feast." So spake he, and my heart and lordly soul 
were warmed within me, even grieved as I was ; and altering 
my voice I spake to him winged words : " Of these then I 
know ; but do thou tell me of a third man, who being still 
alive is held back from home on the vast deep, or dead per- 
chance ; and fain am I to hear, even grieved though I be." So 
spake I, and straightway he answering addressed me : " It is the 
son of Laertes, having his home in Ithaca ; and him I saw in an 
island shedding big tears in the halls of the nymph Calypso, 
Avho keepeth him there by force ; and he cannot go to his own 
native land, for he has not by him ships with oars and comrades 
who might speed him over the broad back of the sea. But for 
thee it is not ordained, Menelaus, reared of Zeus, to die and 
meet thy fate in Argos, the land that breedeth horses. But the 
deathless gods will send thee to the Elysian plain and the end 
of the world, where is fair-haired llbadamanthus, where indeed 
1 6 HOMER. 
is life most easy for men. There is no snow, nor yet any 
mighty storm, nor even rain, but continually Ocean sendeth 
forth the breezes of the shrill-blowing zephyr to refresh men : 
for that thou hast Helen to wife and art in their eyes the son- 
in-law of Zeus." So speaking he dived beneath the seething 
main. 
571. ' But I went with my god-like comrades to the ships, and 
o'er many things my heart brooded darkly within me as I went. 
But when we had come to the ship and to the sea, and made 
ready the supper, and immortal night had come on, then indeed 
did we lay us down to sleep by the breakers of the sea. And 
so soon as early-born Dawn shone forth, rosy-fingered, first of 
all we drew down our ships to the shining sea, and set therein 
masts and sails in the rounded ships, and the men too going on 
board sat them on the benches ; and sitting in order they smote 
the gray sea- water with their oars. And back to the waters of 
the ^gyptus, heaven-fed river, did I bring my ships, and did 
acceptable hecatombs. Then when I had appeased the wrath 
of the gods who live for aye, I heaped a mound for Agamemnon, 
so that his fame might never be quenched. And when I had 
done these things I set sail, and they gave me a favouring 
breeze, the deathless gods who wafted me swiftly to mine own 
dear land. But come now, abide in my halls till the eleventh 
or twelfth day hence shall come on, and then will I duly speed 
thee forth, and I will give thee a splendid gift, three horses 
and a well-polished chariot ; and moreover I will give thee a 
goodly cup that thou may est pour forth libations to the death- 
less gods, being mindful of me all thy days.' 
593. And to him in his turn wise Telemachus made reply : 
' Son of Atreus, hold me not for a long time here. Yea, even 
for a year's space would I endure to sit by thee, nor even would 
the desire of home or parents come upon me : for vastly am I 
delighted by thy tales and talk as I listen. But already my 
comrades are distressed for me in goodly Pylos, and yet thou 
boldest me here for a long time. And as for the gift, whatso- 
ever thou mayest give me, let it be a thing to treasure : horses 
I will not take to Ithaca, but here will I leave them for a joy 
to thyself ; for thou rulest over a wide plain wherein is much 
clover, and galingale therewith, and wheat, and rye, and white 
17 
barley broad in the ear. In Ithaca are no broad courses nor 
meadow-land at all. Browsed by goats is it, and fairer than a 
land that pastureth horses. For no one of the islands which 
lean upon the sea is fit for the driving of horses nor possessed 
of fair meadows : and even so is Ithaca beyond all others.' 
609. So spake he, and Menelaus of the loud war-cry smiled 
and with his hand fondled him and spake, and called him by 
name : 
611. 'Thou art of noble blood, my dear child, such words 
dost thou speak ; therefore I will change thee these presents? 
for I can. And of the gifts, as many treasures as are stored in 
my house, I will give thee the fairest and the one of greatest 
price. I will give thee a well-wrought bowl : and it is all of 
silver, and the rims thereof are finished off with gold, and it is 
the work of Hephaestus : and the hero Phsedimus gave it to me, 
the king of the Sidonians, when his house sheltered me as I 
was returning thither : and to thee now am I fain to give it.' 
620. Thus they spake such words to one another, while the 
guests were coming to the palace of the god-like king. And 
they drave sheep and brought wine that gladdeneth the heart ; 
and their wives with fair wimples sent them bread. So they 
were busy about a feast in the halls. 
625. But the wooers in front of the hall of Odysseus made 
merry, casting quoits and spears in a levelled place, just where 
they had cast before, being wanton. And Antinous was seated 
there, and god-like Eurymachus, the chief men of the wooers, 
and in valour they were excellent beyond the rest. And coming 
near them Noemon, the son of Phronios, questioning Antinous, 
addressed him in words : 
632. ' Antinous, know we at all in our hearts or perchance 
know we not, when Telemachus will return from sandy Pylos ? 
He hath gone, taking a ship from me : and I have need thereof 
to go across into broad-spaced Elis, where I have twelve mares, 
and hardy mules unbroken at the teat : and of these I would 
fain drive off one and tame him.' 
638. So spake he, and they were astonied in their heart, for 
they deemed not that he had gone to Neleian Pylos, but that he 
was somewhere at home on his lands with his flocks or with the 
swineherd. 
OD. IV. 2 
18 ?????. 
G41. And to him in turn spake Antinous, son of Eupeitbes : 
' Tell me true, when went he away and what noble youths 
followed with him ? were they picked men of Ithaca, or thralls 
and servants of his own? even that could he accomplish. And 
tell me this truly, that I may know it aright, whether did he 
take away from thee thy dark ship by force against thy will, or 
didst thou grant it him willingly, when he entreated thee with 
prayers ?' 
648. And to him the son of Phronios, Noemon, made reply : 
' I myself willingly gave it him : what could even another man 
do, when such an one entreated it with troubles in his heart ? 
'twere difficult to refuse the gift. And the noble youths who 
after us are noblest in the township, they followed with him 
and I marked their leader step on board, Mentor, or a god who 
in all things resembled the man himself. But at this do I 
marvel. I saw the goodly Mentor here yesterday just before 
the dawn. But then he went on board the ship to Pylos.' 
657. So having spoken, he went away to the house of his 
father, and the haughty spirit of these twain was angered. 
And they made the wooers sit down together and stayed them 
from their sports. Then to them spake Antinous, son of 
Eupeithes, raging : and his darkened heart was mightily filled 
with wrath, and his eyes were like glowing fire : 
663. ' Out upon him, truly a great deed hath been wrought 
o'erweeningly by Telemachus, even this journey : and we 
declared that it was not being brought to pass by him. This 
lad, as ye see, is clean gone in spite of so many of us here, 
hauling down his ship and choosing out the best men in the 
township. He will get the start of us to be our ruin. But 
may Zeus destroy his force, ere he bring to pass a bane for us ! 
But come, give me a swift ship and twenty comrades, that I 
may lay an ambush for him on his coming, and keep watch in 
the straits of Ithaca and rock-bound Samos, so that he may sail 
with woe full bitter in search of his father.' 
673. So spake he, and they all agreed and urged him on ; 
then rising up forthwith they went into the house of 
Odysseus. 
675. Nor indeed was Penelope for long time unaware of the 
plans which the wooers had brooded over deep down in their 
ODYSSEY, BOOK IV. 10 
hearts ; for the henchman Medon told her thereof, who had 
heard their counsel, being without the court : and they within 
were weaving their guile. And he proceeded to go through the 
house to tell the tidings to Penelope. And as he stepped down 
from the threshold Penelope said unto him : 
681. ' Henchman, and wherefore have the noble wooers sent 
thee here ? whether to tell the hand-maidens of god-like 
Odysseus to cease from their work and prepare themselves a 
feast ? Would that they had never wooed me nor met me 
here or elsewhere, but might now here sup for their last and 
latest time ! ye who thronging ofttimes devour much liveli- 
hood, the wealth of the prudent Telemachus ! Nor did ye ever 
in any wise nor in days gone by hear from your sires, when ye 
were boys, what manner of man Odysseus was among your 
parents, ne'er doing nor saying aught unrighteous in the town- 
ship : and this is the custom of god-like kings. One man a 
king is like to hate, another he may love. But he did never 
aught reckless unto any man. Nay, but your spirit and shame- 
ful deeds are plain, nor is there any gratitude remaining with 
you for acts of kindness shown.' 
696. And to her in turn answered Medon, sage in thought : 
' queen, would indeed that this were the greatest evil ! But 
another far greater and more grievous are the wooers devising, 
which may Cronion ne'er bring to pass ! Eager are the}' to slay 
Telemachus with the sharp sword on his homeward return, for 
he went for tidings of his father to goodly Pylos and to fair 
Lacedsemon.' 
703. So spake he, and there upon the spot her knees were 
loosened and her dear heart, and for a long time speechlessness 
held her. And her eyes twain were filled with tears, and the 
flow of her voice was stayed. But at "length indeed, answering 
in words, she addressed him : 
707. ' Henchman, and wherefore hath my son gone ? No 
need in any wise was there for him to mount on board the 
swift-sailing ships, which are unto men as horses on the deep 
sea, and traverse the wide waters. Is it that even his own 
name should not be left among mortals ?' 
711. And then Medon, sage in thought, answered her: 'I 
know not whether some god constrained hiui. or whether 
20 HdER. 
perchance his own spirit was eager to go unto Pylos, that so he 
may hear either of his father's return, or what fate he had met.' 
715. Having then thus spoken he departed through the 
house of Odysseus, but about her there was shed a soul- 
consuming grief. Nor indeed could she any longer endure to 
sit upon a chair, though there were full many in the house, but 
there she crouched on the threshold of the well-fashioned cham- 
ber, lamenting piteously, and round about her hand-maidens 
wailed, all of them, as many as were in the house, young and 
old. And to them spake Penelope, having wept her fill : 
722. ' Hearken, my friends : for to me the Olympian sire 
hath given griefs above all other women who were born and 
bred together with me, Avho erstwhile lost a noble husband of 
lion heart, equipped with all virtues among the Danai, a noble 
husband whose fame is spread wide throughout Hellas and mid 
Argos. And now again the storm-winds have snatched away 
my well-loved son without tidings from the halls, nor did I 
hear of him as he went away. Ah, cruel women, ye did not 
even have this thought in your minds, each of you, to rouse me 
up from my bed when he went away to his hollow black ship, 
though ye knew of it full well in your hearts ! For had I 
known that he was purposing this journey, verily either should 
he have tarried here, though full eager for the way, or have left 
me dead in the halls ! But let some one speedily summon the 
aged Dolius, my slave whom my father gave me when I was yet 
coming hither, and who keepeth my garden, filled with trees, 
so that with all speed, seated by Laertes, he may tell him all these 
things, if so be perchance Laertes may weave some counsel in 
his heart, and coming forth make his lament to the people who 
are fain to destroy his seed, and the seed of god-like Odysseus.' 
742. And to her answered in her turn her dear nurse Eury- 
cleia : ' Lady dear, do thou then slay me with the pitiless sword, 
or else leave me in the halls : yet will I not conceal the tale 
from thee. I knew all this, and gave him as many things as he 
bade me, bread and sweet wine ; and he took a great oath of 
me not to tell thee till the twelfth day at least therefrom was 
come, or till thou thyself shouldest miss him and hear of him 
that he was speeding on his way, so that thou mightest not 
by weeping mar thy fair skin. Nay, now, having laved thee and 
ODYSSEY, BOOK IV. 21 
taken for thy skin clean raiment, go thou up to thy upper 
chamber with thy attendant maidens, and pray to Athene, the 
daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus ; for so she may yet save him 
even from death. And trouble not an old man in his troubles : 
for I deem not that the race of Arcesius is altogether hateful 
to the blessed gods, but I ween some one will still remain to 
possess the high-vaulted halls and far away the rich fields.' 
758. So she spake, and lulled her lady's grief and stayed her 
eyes from grief. And she, having laved her and taken for her 
skin clean raiment, went up to the upper chamber with her 
attendant maidens, and there she placed barley-groats in a 
basket, and prayed to Athene : 
762. 'Hear me, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, unwearied 
maiden, if ever Odysseus of many wiles in these halls have 
burnt for thee fat thighs of oxen or of sheep, remember now 
these things, I pray thee, and save me my dear son, and ward 
from him the wooers in their wicked pride.' 
767. So speaking, she cried aloud, and the goddess heard her 
prayer. And the wooers clamoured throughout the shadowy 
halls : and thas would some one of the proud youths say : 
770. ' Lo, of a truth, the much- wooed queen prepareth for 
us marriage, and knoweth not a whit how that death hath been 
ordained for her son.' 
772. Thus then would one of them say, but they knew not 
these things, how they were ordained. And to them Antinous 
made harangue and spake : 
774. ' Ye reckless men, shun all o'erweening words alike, lest 
perchance some one should tell them even in the house. But 
come, arising in silence let us accomplish that plan whereof we 
spake, inasmuch as it pleased us all in our hearts.' 
778. So speaking, he chose out twenty men, the best of all, 
and they proceeded to go to the swift ship and the shore of the 
sea. And first of all they drew the ship down to the deep 
water, and therewith placed in the dark ship both a mast and 
sails, and fitted the oars in leathern loops all in due order, and 
spread out the white sails. And proud squires bare their arms 
for them. And high out in the shore water they moored her, 
and themselves disembarked ; and then they took supper and 
waited for evening to come on. 
22 HOMER. 
787. But the ????? Penelope for her part lay in her upper 
chamber fasting, tasting nor meat nor drink, pondering whether 
her noble son would escape death, or whether he would be slain 
by the o'erweening wooers. And like as a lion broods in the 
press of men, fearing when they draw the ensnaring ring around 
him, as she lay pondering even like unto him, upon her came 
deep sleep. And sinking back, she slept, and all her limbs were 
loosed. 
795. Then again did the goddess, gray-eyed Athene, mark 
other thoughts. She made a phantom, and in shape she likened 
it unto a woman, Iphthime, the daughter of great-hearted 
Icarius, whom Eumelus, having his home in Pherse, took to 
wife. And she sent it to the house of god-like Odysseus, that 
it might stay Penelope, as she wailed and grieved, from her 
mourning and her tearful grief. And it entered into the 
chamber by the strap of the bolt, and stood over her head, and 
spake to her these words : 
804, ' Sleepest thou, Penelope, smitten in thy dear heart ? 
Nay, the gods living at ease suffer thee not to weep nor to be 
afflicted, since thy son will yet return : for he is nowise a sinner 
in the eyes of the gods.' 
BOB. And to her again wise Penelope made answer, as she 
slumbered full sweetly at the gates of dreams : 
BIO. ' Wherefore, sister, hast thou come hither ? Not indeed 
erstwhile wast thou wont at all to come, for thou dwellest in 
thy home exceeding far away : and thou biddest me to cease 
from my sorrows and many pains, which torture me in my 
heart and in my soul, me who erstwhile lost a noble husband 
of lion heart, equipped with all virtues among the Danai, a 
noble hu&band, whose fame is spread wide throughout Hellas 
and mid Argos. And now again my well-loved son has gone 
away on a hollow ship, poor boy, knowing naught aright of 
toils nor of the gatherings of men. And for him then I mourn 
e'en more than for that other. And I tremble for him, and 
fear lest he should suffer aught, either in the township of these 
where he is gone, or on the deep, for many foemon are contriv- 
ing plots against him, longing to slay him ere he comes to his 
own native land.' 
824. And to her replying, the phantom dim made answer : 
ODYSSEY, BOOK IV. 23 
' Take heart, nor fear at all too much within thine heart, for 
such an escort goes with him as even others have prayed for 
to stand by them — for she is mighty — even Pallas Athene. 
And she pitieth thee as thou weepest, and even now sent me 
hither to speak these things unto thee.' 
830. And to her again spake wise Penelope : ' If in good 
sooth thou art a god, and didst hearken to the voice of a god, 
come, I pray thee, tell me tidings of that ill-fated man, 
whether perchance he still lives and sees the light of the sun, 
or whether he is already dead, and in the house of Hades.' 
835. And to her replying, the phantom dim made answer : 
' Verily I will not indeed tell thee plainly of him whether he 
in truth be alive or dead : 'tis ill to speak light words.' 
838. So speaking the phantom slipped away by the bolt of 
the door-post, into the breath of the wind : and she leapt up 
from her sleep, even the daughter of Icarius, and her heart 
within her was gladdened, so clear was the vision that sped 
toward her in the murk of night. 
842. But the wooers, having embarked, were sailing over the 
dank paths, planning in their hearts sheer death for Telemachus. 
Now there is a rocky island in the midst of the sea midway 
'twixt Ithaca and rugged Samos, Asteris, a little island : and 
a harbour there is therein with a double entrance with anchor- 
age for ships : there the Achaeansawaited-him, lying in ambush.

The Tutorial Series consists of Text-Booka and Guides specially 
written to meet the reciuirements of the various London University 
Examinations by Tutors of Univeksity ConRESPONDRNCE College. 
All Latin and Greek Classics prescribed for London University are 
translated in the Tutorial Series, and also edited if no thoroughly 
suitable commentary has already been issued. Vocabularies in order 
of the Text are prepared for Matriculation and Intermediate Arts. 
The expense involved in purchasing, for the study of short periods 
of History and Literature, a large book which often contains a few 
pages only of relevant matter is obviated by the issue of works 
specially written for the purposes of the Examination. Such works 
are provided in the Tutorial Series for each Intermediate Arts 
Examination, and also for B.A. whenever there is a distinct want. 
In fine, the Tutorial Series fills the gap which students seeking 
editions of the special subjects prescribed by London University will 
find existing in current literature.
